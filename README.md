**Samanantar dataset** which is the largest publicly available parallel corpora collection for Indic languages.\
Below is the link provide to download the parallel corpus data of required English-X (indic-language) :\
         **https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/samanantar/**   \
In our work we considered the below language pairs :\
	**• English-Hindi (en-hi) :** This contains **8.56 million sentence pairs.**\
	**• English-Telugu (en-te) :** This contains **4.82 million sentence pairs.**\
Before getting into the wider spectrum of work we performed two levels of filtration over the two language pair corpora to get the filtered data.\
**Filtration levels :**\
	**Level 1 :** Extraction of sentences between **sentence (word) length of threshold 5 to 100.** \
	Below are the number of sentences extracted in each language pair.\
	      **- English-Hindi (en-hi) : 79,61,610 sentences\
		    - English-Telugu (en-te) : 30,36,823 sentences**\
	**Level 2 :** Removing the corresponding parallel sentences from both English-Hindi (en-hi) files which has **english text in hindi file** and **junk in both english text file and hindi text files.**\
		  **- Retained english & hindi sentences : 76,22,024 sentences\
		    - Filtered english & hindi sentences : 3,39,586 sentences**\
  Similarly removing the corresponding parallel sentences from both English-Telugu (en-te) files which has **english text in telugu file** and **junk in both english text file and hindi text files.** \
  Below are the number of sentences extracted in each language pair.\
		  **- Retained english & telugu sentences : 29,68,429 sentences\
		    - Filtered english & telugu sentences : 68,394 sentences**\
